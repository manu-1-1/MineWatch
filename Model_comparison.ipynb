    "XGBoost was selected as the final model because it achieved the highest F1-score while maintaining a strong balance between precision and recall, making it most suitable for detecting cryptojacking attacks where minimizing false negatives is critical.\n",
    "Although LightGBM achieved performance comparable to XGBoost, the latter was selected due to its marginally superior F1-score and reduced feature set, indicating better generalization capability for cryptojacking detection."
