MineWatch is a lightweight, ML-based anomaly detection utility designed to identify cryptojacking-like behavior by monitoring abnormal system resource usage.

The tool uses machine learning to learn normal system behavior and flags sustained deviations that may indicate unauthorized cryptomining activity.
